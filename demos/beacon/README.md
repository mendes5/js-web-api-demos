# Beacon API

[MDN Link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Beacon_API)

---

Sends an asynchronous request to the server.

Unlike requests made using XMLHttpRequest or the Fetch API, the browser guarantees to initiate beacon requests before the page is unloaded and to run them to completion.


`ArrayBufferView`, `Blob`, `DOMString`, or `FormData` can be used as the data payload.
